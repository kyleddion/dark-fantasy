# Dark Fantasy Game Skeleton

This repository contains the beginnings of a dark fantasy action game built for **Unity 2022.3.62f1**. It is inspired by challenging combat RPGs.

## Setup
1. Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor version `2022.3.62f1`.
2. Clone this repository and open it with Unity Hub.
3. Open the sample scene in `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity` to see a basic setup.
4. Add your own scenes to `Assets/Scenes` and include them in the build settings.
5. Attach the provided scripts to your prefabs and configure the components.

## Project Structure
- `Assets/Scripts` – gameplay scripts such as `PlayerController`, `EnemyController`, and `GameManager`.
- `Assets/Scenes` – contains the `Main.unity` sample scene and room for new scenes.
- `ProjectSettings` – includes project version information to match the required Unity version.

The scripts include placeholders where you can expand the game logic, add animations, combat systems, and additional features.
